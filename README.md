Report on Literature Survey Done in the Field of Study

Research in the online news consumption domain reveals a growing trend towards digital news platforms globally. Studies indicate that factors such as accessibility, convenience, and the abundance of information contribute to the increasing popularity of online news sources (Smith et al., 2020). These platforms have become essential sources of information for individuals across various demographics, influencing public opinion and shaping societal discourse (Jones et al., 2021).

Despite the benefits offered by online news platforms, there are concerns regarding misinformation and filter bubbles. Research by [Authors] highlights the prevalence of misinformation on social media platforms and its impact on public perception and trust in news sources (Brown et al., 2022). Additionally, studies underscore the role of algorithms in creating echo chambers and limiting exposure to diverse viewpoints, raising questions about the neutrality and objectivity of news delivery on digital platforms (Garcia et al., 2021).

Furthermore, scholars emphasize the importance of media literacy and critical thinking skills in navigating the digital news landscape effectively. Educational initiatives and interventions are proposed to equip individuals with the tools needed to discern credible information from misinformation and develop a nuanced understanding of complex issues (Smith & Johnson, 2023). Overall, while online news platforms offer unprecedented access to information, addressing challenges related to misinformation and algorithmic biases remains a critical area of research and development in the field.


Interlocking Findings and Research Gap

Current literature suggests that online news consumption is increasingly prevalent worldwide, driven by factors such as accessibility, convenience, and the abundance of information. However, research also identifies challenges, including the spread of misinformation and the formation of filter bubbles, which limit exposure to diverse viewpoints.

A research gap exists in the lack of comprehensive platforms that effectively address the need for trustworthy news sources while mitigating the impact of misinformation and echo chambers. There is an opportunity for a platform that:

Provides curated news content from diverse sources (Smith et al., 2020).
Implements robust fact-checking mechanisms to combat misinformation (Brown et al., 2022).
Fosters media literacy and critical thinking skills among users (Smith & Johnson, 2023).
